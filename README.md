# Under-Voltage-Protection-System
This system is designed to safeguard electrical circuits from low voltage conditions. The development process encompassed meticulous design, thorough testing, and careful implementation to ensure its reliability and safety. For this project, we utilized key components such as a voltage sensor (ZMPT101B), Arduino UNO R3, a 5V relay, and an LCD display. The resulting system effectively demonstrates the protection mechanism against undervoltage scenarios.![Circuit_Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f20c108a-15cd-492b-87b0-42a5409f7d1e)
